## Brief overview
These guidelines capture preferences for creating project management and agile artifacts, specifically for GitHub issue templates within this project. The core principles are simplicity and clarity, tailored for a team that is new to tech and agile methodologies.

## Language and Communication
- Initial requests may be made in Spanish, but all final artifacts, documentation, and template files must be in English.
- The tone should be direct and clear, avoiding overly complex jargon.

## Artifact and Template Design
- Prioritize simplicity in all templates. Reduce the number of fields to the essential minimum to avoid overwhelming the team.
- Fields in templates should be optional unless absolutely critical for the task's definition.
- Use clear and descriptive labels and placeholders that guide the user.

## Documentation
- When new processes or artifacts (like issue templates) are introduced, always update a corresponding `README.md` or other relevant documentation.
- Documentation should be concise and easy for new team members to understand.
