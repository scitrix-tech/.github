## Brief overview
This document outlines the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principles for Scitrix projects. It provides guidelines for creating reusable logic, components, and configurations to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.

## Core DRY Principles
- **Extract Reusable Logic**: If a piece of code is used in three or more places, it should be extracted into a shared location like a custom hook or utility function.
- **Component Composition**: Use composition patterns, such as creating shared prop interfaces or compound components, to build complex UIs from smaller, reusable parts.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Store all configuration values, such as environment variables and design tokens, in centralized files to avoid scattering them throughout the codebase.
- **Form Patterns**: Define reusable validation schemas and form hooks to handle form logic consistently across the application.
- **API Integration Patterns**: Abstract API interactions into reusable functions or hooks to streamline data fetching and mutations.
- **Styling Patterns**: Use utility-class variants (e.g., with `cva`) to create a consistent and reusable set of styling patterns for components.
- **Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error handling strategy with custom error classes and reusable handler functions.
- **Shared Type Definitions**: Create generic and shared TypeScript types to ensure data consistency across the application.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Over-abstraction**: Avoid abstracting code that is only used once or twice. Wait for clear patterns to emerge.
- **Premature Optimization**: Don't create complex abstractions for simple, infrequently used code.
- **God Objects/Functions**: Avoid creating functions or objects that do too many unrelated things.
- **Tight Coupling**: Ensure that abstractions do not create unnecessary dependencies between different parts of the application.
