- **Bug Report**: Use this to report a bug. The form will guide you to provide all the necessary details for us to reproduce and fix the issue.
- **Feature Request**: Use this to propose a new feature or an enhancement. The form will help you structure your idea.

### Pull Request Template

When you open a pull request, the description will be pre-filled with a template. Please fill out the checklist to ensure your contribution meets our standards. This helps us review and merge your changes faster.
