# Community Health Files for the Scitrix Project

This directory contains files that help manage and standardize community contributions to the Scitrix project. These include templates for issues and pull requests.

## Purpose

The goal of these files is to make the contribution process smoother, more consistent, and easier for everyone, especially for new contributors. By providing structured templates, we can ensure that bug reports and feature requests contain all the necessary information for the development team to take action.

## Files

- **`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`**: This directory contains the templates for creating new issues.
  - `config.yml`: Configures the "New Issue" page, directing users to the correct templates and disabling blank issues to encourage structured feedback.
  - `bug_report.yml`: A form for submitting detailed bug reports.
  - `feature_request.yml`: A form for proposing new features.
- **`pull_request_template.md`**: This is the default template that will be pre-filled in the description of any new pull request. It includes a checklist to ensure contributions are complete and follow project guidelines.
